# Netflix Clone

A Clone of the Netflix UI (of course, is in the name), made for learning purposes.  
All the code should not be consider final, so don't see the bad organization :)  
If you want to see my other serious project, check [bossa](https://github.com/BarbosaRT/Bossa)  

PS: Netflix pls don't sue me :)
